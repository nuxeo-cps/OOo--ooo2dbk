Description: converts OpenOffice.org SXW documents to DocBook XML
 OOo2Dbk allows to convert documents from OpenOffice-Writer SXW format to
 a simplified DocBook XML format.
 .
 OOo2Dbk is made of an XSLT stylesheet and a set of Python scripts that
 permit direct processing of SXW documents and extraction of the pictures
 included in the document.
 .
 It can also be used autonomously in order to convert OpenOffice-Writer
 XML documents produced with a FlatXML filter.
 .
 The original version of ooo2dbk is ooo2sdbk, written
 by Eric Bellot. This version can still be found at
 http://www.chez.com/ebellot/ooo2sdbk/
 .
 OOo2Dbk can at the moment only process files generated by the
 OpenOffice.org 1.1.x series.
 .
 Future versions of OOo2Dbk will process files generated by the
 OpenOffice.org 2.x series.
