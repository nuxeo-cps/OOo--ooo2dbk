- Code cleaning: Remove the use of "global" variables.

- File and image directory processing should be done in a temporary directory
  rather than in the current directory (both when a single file or an archive
  file is asked).

- Rework the RPM generation so that it doesn't rely on any sudo or privileged
  processings.

- On Mandrake the default OpenOffice.org installation resides in
  /usr/lib/openoffice so maybe the ooo2dbk.xml conf file of the RPM package
  should reflect this. On another hand the default install of a stock
  OpenOffice.org is in /opt/OpenOffice.org1.1.4.

- ???? Automatically generates xslt and user defined textfields based on docbook possible metadatas (DTD ?)

- Take jobtitle and quality correctly into naccount in the docbook.xsl

- Deploy ooo2dbk as a module using distutils : need to rename to .py and create a caller script
