Presentation
============

OOo2DBK is an OpenOffice.org document (ODT and SXW) to DocBook XML converter. It
can produce both DocBook "article" and DocBook "book" documents.

The online reference presenting all the available DocBook elements is
http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/

ooo2dbk widely extends ooo2sdbk, written by Eric Bellot. This
version can still be found at http://www.chez.com/ebellot/ooo2sdbk/

A modified version of ooo2sdbk has also be done in 2003 by Stefan Rinke and can
be found at http://www.stefan-rinke.de/articles/publish/en/

Use the templates provided in the ooo directory of this package to create your own OOo
documents from which DocBook documents will be generated.
These templates (in French and English) contain all the information on
installing and using OOo2dbk.

Features and changes over ooo2sdbk
==================================

  * DocBook support
    o Generating "DocBook XML V4.3".
    o Generating DocBook "article" or DocBook "book" documents based on user
      choice, generated documents have the corresponding structure.
    o Added new generic support for both DocBook preface and 
      appendix elements.
    o Added support for superscript and subscript elements.
    o Adding support for cell alignment in tables.
    o Added support for "border" styles of table cells. The 
      border information is passed as processing instructions that the 
      following XSLT stylesheets are able to process.
    o Added support for "font-name" from OOo that could be used 
      to mark fonts with symbols.

  * OpenOffice.org interactions
    o Added support for meta-information set via 
      text:user-field-decl OOo elements.
    o Do not display not visible sections (text:display="none").
    
  * Options and configuration
    o Added -zFILE/--zipfile=FILE option for generating zipped archive of output
      DocBook document with subobjecs (if any).
    o Augmented the config.xml configuration file so that each "xslt-command"
      element has now a "param-syntax" attribute. This is done because XSLT
      processors have different command line options. ooo2dbk now deals better
      with the different available XSLT processors.
    o Added an -xFILE/--xslt=FILE option to specify an alternative XSLT
      stylesheet to be able to simply customize ooo2dbk.xsl by importing it from
      another stylesheet.
    o Added a "-v/--verbose" option to the ooo2dbk script.
